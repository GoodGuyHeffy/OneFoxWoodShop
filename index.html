<p>Tried my hand at making a Liquor Shelf, it’s not perfect but I did what I could with what I had. Turned out better than I thought and was happy with the results, there’s also a strip of RGB light on the inside for added effect in low lighting/ dark rooms</p>

<h2>Keepsake Box</h2>

<p>Got asked to make a jewelry/keepsake box with a name and an engraving on top a while back as a Valentine’s Day gift. They said they have no complaints 🤙As simple as a box is, I’d never made one yet so first time was pretty ok</p>
